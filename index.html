<h1 class="science"><i><b><u>Why is Science important?</u></b></i></h1><br>

<p class="kid">Today you would ask any little kid, "What do you imagine when you think of science?", and the little kid would go into deep thought before answering
 "A scientist mixing chemicals in a lab" or "a rocket travelling in space". This common mentality is due to the fact that most people have never looked deep into what really science is.
 A very general way of defining science in my opinion would be-: Science is the way of understandning the physical, natural, and imaginary world. Beleive it or not, 
 it is nothing more complex than that. That is what scientists do; they observe a phenomenon → which leads them to form a question → then they make a hypothesis 
 → design and conduct an experiment → collect results → analyze the results → draw a conclusion → and then modify their hypothesis if needed. This systematic and logical method 
 of understadning nature is what we call the scientific method. And this texhnique is not limited to scientists in laboritories or astronauts in space. In fact, 
 we use it in everyday life.

    A word about my school...
</h3>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
<p>Yes, I go to the Bronx High School of Science. It is one of the nine specialized high schools in New York City, and is ranked as one of the best high schools in the country.
    I find myself very fortunate to be a student there. This high school has the most number of nobel prize laureates among all high schools in the United States. It has eight nobel prize laureates 
    of which seven are in physics.

Among its electronic resources is ScienceDirect, a free science journal service provided by Elsevier to a select few science high schools. It is used by students as a gateway to firsthand experience with published scientific research.
